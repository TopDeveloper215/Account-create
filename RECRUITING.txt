You have to select virtual assistants and, for example on Fiverr. You'll select people without experience so without reviews and who joined the platform recently. We'll have to train them so the prior experience is not important for us.

WHO WE ARE: we're a small agency based in Germany. We do self publishing so we publish books on several platform like Amazon, Ingramspark, draft2digital etc...
We don't have a presence of the social media so if they want more info and they insist just ignore them.


The message you'll use on those platforms is this:

Answer me if you want me to share all the details.

Thanks  



If they ask what is (att) is, of course, the symbol used in every e mail address but we can't write it don't don't violate the TOS of Fiverr and other platforms.

If they'll ask you to share information on Fiverr you'll say to contact the manager because you don't have the information. 

If they don't want to work outside the platform just ignore them and move forward.
